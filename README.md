# ArnoldC Technical Documentation

This is one of the front-end project challenges by [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page).

The purpose of this page is to introduce the basic concepts and syntax of the **ArnoldC** language built on top of java by [Ihartikk](https://github.com/lhartikk).
